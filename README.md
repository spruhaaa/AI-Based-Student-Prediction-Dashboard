# AI-Based-Student-Prediction-Dashboard
Objective is to use machine learning to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on key indicators like attendance and marks. Beyond prediction, we also aim to visualize student trends and generate customized, downloadable PDF reports. Filters such as gender and department make the dashboard more insightful and practical

Solution Overview:
We built a full web application using Python and Streamlit. The user uploads a CSV file containing student data. The dashboard then provides interactive visualizations, prediction results, and individual report cards. It's simple, scalable, and can be hosted using modern AI infrastructure

Technologies Used:
We created a simulated dataset of over 200 students, each with multiple features like student ID, gender, department, attendance percentage, average marks, and the final result. The platform supports uploading new datasets to allow continuous updates and testing.

System Architecture:
Architecture is simple yet robust. The frontend is a responsive Streamlit app. The backend runs machine learning models trained on historical data. Users can filter by gender or department, upload CSV files, and instantly receive predictions and reports. All logic runs on Python with modern ML libraries.

Results & Impact:
Our dashboard allows:
-	Teachers to quickly identify students at risk.
-	Significant time-saving by automating analysis and reporting.
-	Parents to receive easy-to-understand progress reports.
This improves intervention timing and supports informed academic decisions
